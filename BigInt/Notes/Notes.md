## Possible solutions to BigInt

1. Using a series of structs and pointers, we can link intergers into larger ones. This method would likely allow for minimal change to the actual implementation for each operation allowing easy use if wee ever decide to expand the calculator.

2. Another method is using a series of strings to create a larger int. The strings would likely be spilt up and numbered with string 1 being the last digits in the number. Each string if converted to an int should be one digit less that the 32 bit interger limit to account for overflow, such as if an interger becomes to large or small for the digits used in the string section, or if the value becomes a negative number. This method would require extensive modification to each operation. For addition and subtraction operations, each section of the number would be added and subtracted from eachother with a buffer that would be added to the next largest set of numbers in addition or added to the next smallest set of numbers in subtraction. This method would be particullarly dificult for the multiplication operator as it would require a differnt approach to make it succeed. This method would also be particularly difficult to further expand on and implement with other operations.
