## 16 Bit Adder Instructions
1. First, download the "16BitAdder.bin" file from my git repo.
2. Second, Load the .bin file in the Altair 8800 simulator.
3. Next, switch to the 4th adress by doing the following:
    - Enter "0000 0000 0011 0000" with the switches.
    - Then click the examine switch.

4. Next, in the first two bytes in the 4th register enter your first number that you want to add, then in the 3rd and forth bytes enter the other number you want to add.
5. finnallyy click the reset switch and then the run switch.

### Note:
The bigest number the calculator can output is 65535.
