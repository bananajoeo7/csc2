Dear Jeff,

I have created a basic program using the I/O librarys found in the file [Assignment.ASM](https://github.com/bananajoeo7/csc215/blob/main/Notes/CPM_Chapter_14_Folder/Assignment.ASM).

Another File I would like you to look at is a project that I hope to build on as we continue learning.
That project being creating a Madlib, so far I have created one that somewhat works, but I plan to make a better version once I better learn how to create and store variables in the stack.

The current version can be found in my projects folder in the ["Madlib_Project" Folder](https://github.com/bananajoeo7/csc215/tree/main/Projects/Madlib_Project).

Thank you for your time.

Sincerly,
Trostin Geles
