## Section #1 Notes
- In many programming environments the largest value of an integer variable is much too small to represent large quantities such as the population of the world.

5000 Enter operator (+ - * (= to quit)): *
Enter value: 3

Enter operator (+ - * (= to quit)): * Enter value: 4 
——> -5468 
Enter operator (+ - * (= to quit)): =
